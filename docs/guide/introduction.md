# Introduction

This tutorial shows how to use the **visual** Python package (bundled in this project) to instrument algorithms, capture runtime snapshots, and render them in the browser via Pyodide.

You will learn:

- How snapshots and breakpoints work
- How to watch variables, arrays, matrices, and node/graph structures
- How to map injected line numbers back to source code for accurate highlighting
- How to troubleshoot common issues when running Python in Pyodide

Prerequisites:

- Basic Python
- Familiar with running code in the browser (Pyodide) is helpful but not required
